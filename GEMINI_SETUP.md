## 🚀 How to Enable AI (Optional)

### Get Your Free API Key

1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

### Add to Your `.env` File

Open `server/.env` and add:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_key_here
```

### Restart Backend Server

```bash
# In server terminal (Ctrl+C to stop, then:)
npm run dev
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Without API Key (Default)
```
Analyze Resume → Rule-Based Prediction → Results
```
- Uses smart pattern matching
- Instant results
- Free forever
- `aiPowered: false` in response

### With API Key (Enhanced)
```
Analyze Resume → Try Gemini AI → Success → AI Results
                              → Fail → Rules (fallback)
```
- Uses Gemini's language understanding
- More context-aware
- Takes 1-2 seconds
- `aiPowered: true` in response
- Shows "✨ AI-Powered" badge in UI

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Without API Key (Current State)
1. Analyze any resume
2. Check console: Should say "📋 Using rule-based career path prediction"
3. UI: No "✨ AI-Powered" badge
4. Result: Works perfectly with rules

### Test 2: With API Key (After you add it)
1. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env`
2. Restart backend server
3. Analyze resume
4. Check console: Should say "🤖 Using Gemini AI..."
5. UI: Shows "✨ AI-Powered" badge
6. Result: More personalized predictions

### Test 3: Invalid API Key (Error Handling)
1. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY=invalid_key`
2. Analyze resume
3. Check console: "⚠️ Gemini AI failed, falling back to rule-based"
4. Result: Still works (using rules as fallback)

## 💡 What the AI Does Better

**Rule-Based** (Current):
- ✅ Fast, deterministic
- ✅ Good for common cases
- ❌ Can't understand nuanced career transitions
- ❌ Fixed role mappings

**AI-Powered** (With Gemini):
- ✅ Understands context ("worked on React during internship" → Frontend focus)
- ✅ Detects non-obvious skills
- ✅ Better for unique career paths
- ✅ Adapts to new technologies

## 📈 Cost & Limits

**Free Tier**:
- 60 requests/minute
- 1,500 requests/day
- Perfect for portfolio/demo

**If you exceed** (unlikely):
- Paid tier: ~$0.0025/request
- Still very cheap!

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Demo/Portfolio**: Add the API key! It's free and impressive.

**Before Interview**: Show both modes:
1. "Here's the rule-based version (instant, free)"
2. "And here's the AI-enhanced version (smarter, still free)"
3. Demonstrates your understanding of both approaches

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Do I need the API key?**
A: No! The app works perfectly without it using rules.

**Q: Is my API key safe?**
A: Yes, it's in `.env` which is NOT committed to Git (in `.gitignore`).

**Q: Can I use OpenAI instead?**
A: Yes, but Gemini's free tier is better for testing.

**Q: What if the AI gives weird predictions?**
A: The prompt has strict rules to prevent that. Plus, there's automatic fallback logic.
